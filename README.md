## Introduction

The Task Management System is a web-based application that allows users to efficiently manage tasks. This repository contains both the frontend and backend components of the system.

## Features

- **Backend:**
  - CRUD operations for tasks using appropriate HTTP methods.
  - Integration with a MySQL database for storing task information.
  - Basic authentication and authorization mechanisms for API endpoints.

- **Frontend:**
  - User-friendly interface for interacting with the Task Management System.
  - Functionality to add, update, delete, and mark tasks as complete.

- **General:**
  - Follows coding standards, naming conventions, and best practices.
  - Error handling and validation on both frontend and backend.
  - Comprehensive documentation for the codebase and setup instructions.

## Technologies Used

- Flask (Python) for the backend API.
- MySQL for the relational database.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-management-system.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd task-management-system`
3. Set up the virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Create and configure the database: `python manage.py db upgrade`
7. Run the application: `python app.py`
8. Access the application in your browser: `http://localhost:5000`

## Backend

The backend is built using Flask, a Python web framework. It provides API endpoints for task operations and interacts with a MySQL database.

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/tasks`: Retrieve all tasks.
- `POST /api/tasks`: Add a new task.
- `PUT /api/tasks/<task_id>`: Update a task.
- `DELETE /api/tasks/<task_id>`: Delete a task.

For more detailed documentation, refer to [API Documentation](/docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md).

## Frontend

The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers an intuitive interface for users to manage tasks.

### User Interface

- Display tasks with options to mark completion, edit, and delete.
- Add new tasks with a user-friendly form.

For screenshots and a visual guide, refer to [User Interface Guide](/docs/USER_INTERFACE_GUIDE.md).

## Database

The application uses a MySQL database to store task information. Database migrations are managed using Flask-Migrate.

For database schema and relationships, refer to [Database Schema](/docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md).

## Security

The application implements basic authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect API endpoints from unauthorized access.

For security considerations and best practices, refer to [Security Guidelines](/docs/SECURITY_GUIDELINES.md).

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive testing suite to ensure the functionality and reliability of the application.

To run tests, execute: `python manage.py test`

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is available for the codebase, API, user interface, and database.
